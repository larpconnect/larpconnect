# Skill: Writing Documentation in Markdown

## Domain Context

This skill handles the creation of markdown documents to document the system.

## Technical Constraints

1. Markdown files are stored in `docs/` but may be placed inside of subdirectories.
2. Markdown files are properly formatted using a structured document format (so favoring headers to represent document structure).
3. Write at a 10th—12th grade level.
4. Assume a knowledge base of a person with a bachelors-level understanding of of theoretical computer science and a familiarity with LARP concepts.
5. Limit line length to 100 characters.
6. Unless otherwise directed the ideal document length is around 512±128 words. This does not apply to code, typeset mathematics, or mermaid.js diagrams that may be included.

## Specific Guidance

* Load documentation from the GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec on context7.
* Prefer that pseudocode be written in mathematical pseudocode. If that is not possible, then use Java.
* Use mermaid.js for diagrams. Load the mermaid.js documentation from context7.
* Files should always be UTF-8
* Try to break up large amounts of text with bullet points, code snippets, multiple sections, or diagrams.
